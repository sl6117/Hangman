# Hangman 
Welcome to my first personal project. \n
This is a simple single player game of Hangman.

## Instructions
1. Open the hangman.py file on Terminal
2. Press Enter to continue with the game.
3. The player is given a random word and 10 guesses to guess the letters that the word consists.
4. The player won't be penalized for a correct guess. However, a guess will be dedeucted for each letter that the word doesn't consist.
5. The player can restart the game when the game is over.
